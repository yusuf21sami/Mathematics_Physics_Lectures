Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns. On a water surface, this can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns can show us how waves combine in different ways, either reinforcing each other or canceling out.

Studying these patterns helps us understand wave behavior in a simple, visual way.

$$
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos\left(kr - \omega t + \phi\right)
$$

where:

- $\eta(x, y, t)$ is the displacement of the water surface at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$,
- $A$ is the amplitude of the wave,
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, related to the wavelength $\lambda$,
- $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency, related to the frequency $f$,

   $$

   where $N$ is the number of sources (vertices of the polygon).

5. **Analyze Interference Patterns:** Examine the resulting displacement $\eta_{\text{sum}}(x, y, t)$ as a function of position $(x, y)$ and time $t$. Identify regions of constructive interference (wave amplification) and destructive interference (wave cancellation).

6. **Visualization:** Present your findings graphically, illustrating the interference patterns for the chosen regular polygon.
